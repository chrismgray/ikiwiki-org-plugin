* Ikiwiki Org Plugin

  This is a plugin for the [[http://ikiwiki.info][ikiwiki]] wiki compiler that interprets
  [[http://orgmode.org][org-mode]] files.

  The plugin is in a beta state -- it should be monitored to ensure
  that it is not hanging -- but is nearly feature-complete and can be
  used instead of the [[http://ikiwiki.info/todo/org_mode/][existing org-mode plugin]].  An example of it in
  action is my [[http://chrismgray.github.com/][blog]].
  
* Motivation

  Why a rewrite of the plugin?
  
** Speed

   The current org-mode plugin is very slow.  It starts a new emacs
   process for every file that is interpreted.  The emacs startup time
   dominates the time for interpreting the file for all but the
   largest files.
   
** Flexibility

   The current org-mode plugin doesn't interpret common org-mode
   directives like =#+TITLE= or =#+AUTHOR=.  These are not hard to
   parse out of the files with Perl, but the better solution is to
   allow org-mode itself to parse the files, and get the information
   from org-mode's internal structures.  
   
* Installation

  There are two main files: =perl/new_org.pm= and
  =lisp/ikiwiki-org-plugin.el=.  The first needs to go in the
  =~/.ikiwiki/IkiWiki/Plugin= directory and the second needs to go somewhere
  in the emacs =load-path=.  However, it is not recommended that you
  =require= the =ikiwiki-org-plugin= file from your usually-running
  emacs -- a new emacs instance is started by the plugin which will
  =require= it for you.

  The plugin must be enabled in your =wiki.setup= or =blog.setup=
  file.  This is done by adding =new_org= to the =add_plugins= list.
  
* Security Warning

  This plugin uses =IPC::open2= to communicate with emacs.  Every effort
  has been made to ensure that the arguments to this function can not
  cause damage, but it is possible that I have missed something.
  Given this, the plugin should not be used in situations where
  malicious input is possible.

  Ideas for how to avoid this problem would be highly appreciated.
